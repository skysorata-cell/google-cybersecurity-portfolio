## About Me

I am currently working as a Quality Assurance professional and transitioning into cybersecurity.
My background in QA has trained me to think analytically, pay close attention to detail, and document findings clearly—skills that strongly align with SOC and security analyst roles.

I am motivated by the importance of protecting data and users, and I am particularly interested in monitoring security events, analyzing logs, identifying suspicious behavior, and supporting incident response processes.

This portfolio reflects my commitment to building practical, job-ready cybersecurity skills and continuously improving as a security professional.
